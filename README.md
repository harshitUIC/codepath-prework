## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

My favorite apps

1) instagram
2) youtube
3) SnapChat
4) Chatgpt

Features I like
1) Instagram reels, the one feature I really like is saving the reels u like and can watch them later, sounds pretty cool to me
2) AI in snapchat filters, is also something which fascinates me.


APP THAT I WILL LIKE TO BUILD

One app i would really like to build would be, a personal finance guide, which not only tracks your expenses but also gives you smart moves to invest, save more, etc. I know there are services which do the same thing, but a service like this on your fingertips would be pretty cool.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
